# Research Experience
## Dept. ECE, Carnegie Mellon University | Research Assistant | Dec 2017 - Present
### Advisor: Prof. Hyong S. Kim, Department of ECE at CMU
### Project: Application of Blockchain into supply chain based on Ethereum platform
- Designed and implemented SmartSupply, a blockchain-based supply chain system in Ethereum platform.
- Designed and demonstrated the feasibility of Ethereum smart contract to validate transactions and organize miner’s
local data structure.
- Explored the limitations of the Ethereum platform and smart contract.
- Benchmarked the system and discussed the trade-off between query latency and accuracy.
- Changed Ethereum source code to revise proof-of-work.
- Implemented a supply chain monitor system based on MSSQL, D3, and OpenLayers.
